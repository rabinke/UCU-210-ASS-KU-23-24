        <h2>Classification of Waves</h2>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">a. <b>Electromagnetic waves - </b>These are waves which do not require material medium for transmission.Examples are radio waves,radiant heat,light and microwave.
            <br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">b. <b>Mechanical waves - </b>These waves which require material medium for transmission.Examples are water waves and sound waves.They can either be transverse or longitudinal. <br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">i. <b>Transverse waves - </b>
            In these waves,the vibration of particles is to right angles to the direction of wave travel.For example water waves,waves on a string and electromagnetic waves ie light,radio,microwaves etc..
             <br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">ii.<b> Longitudinal waves - </b>In these waves,the vibration of the particles is in a direction parallel to the direction of the wave travel.Examples are sound waves. <br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">iii.<b>  Progressive waves - </b> These are waves that move continually away from the source.They can be either transverse or longitudinal.<br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">iv.<b> Pulse - </b> It is generated when a single vibration is sent through a medium.<br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;">v.<b>Speed - </b>The speed V of a wave is the distance covered by the wave in one second. It's S.I unit is m/s.</div> <br></div>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;"><b></b> <br></div>

        <div>f = 1/T</div>
       <div>V = distance travelled by one complete wave 
        / time taken to complete one wave</div>

<h2>Characteristics of wave motion</h2>
 
       <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;"><b>Diffraction : </b>Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles or through openings. It occurs when waves encounter an obstruction that is comparable in size to their wavelength.
         This phenomenon is commonly observed with all types of waves, including sound waves, water waves, and light waves. <br></div> 
         <img src="diffraction.jpeg" id="wave">    
       <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;"><b>Reflection : </b>Reflection is the bouncing back of waves when they encounter a boundary or surface that does not absorb the energy of the wave. The angle of incidence (the angle at which the wave strikes the surface) is equal to the angle of reflection (the angle at which the wave bounces off the surface). 
        This principle is fundamental in optics, acoustics, and other wave-related phenomena. <br></div>
        <img src="rflection.png" id="wave">
       <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;"><b>Refraction : </b>Refraction is the bending of waves as they pass from one medium to another with different properties, such as density or speed. This bending occurs due to a change in the wave's speed, which causes the wavefronts to change direction.
         Refraction is responsible for phenomena like the bending of light through a lens, the bending of sound waves through the atmosphere, and the bending of ocean waves as they approach the shore. <br></div>
         <img src="refraction.png" id="wave">
       <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;"><b>Interference : </b> Interference occurs when two or more waves interact with each other. Depending on whether the waves are in phase (crest aligns with crest, trough aligns with trough) or out of phase (crest aligns with trough), interference can result in either constructive interference (waves amplify each other) or destructive interference (waves cancel each other out). Interference is a key concept in wave phenomena like diffraction, double-slit experiments, and wave optics.<br></div>
       <img src="interference.jpeg" id="wave">
       <div style="margin-bottom: 8px; margin-top: 10px;"><b>Polarization : </b> Polarization refers to the orientation of the oscillations of a wave in a particular direction. Waves can be polarized horizontally, vertically, or in any other direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Polarization is important in understanding phenomena like the transmission of light through polarizing filters and the behavior of electromagnetic waves.<br></div>
